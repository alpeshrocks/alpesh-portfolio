    <h3>Community Grocery Startup</h3>
    <p>I built this from scratch during lockdown — finding suppliers, handling logistics, and serving my neighborhood. We fulfilled ~2,000 orders (~$70k revenue). More importantly, we helped families access essentials affordably and reliably — a small, very real socio‑economic impact I&#x27;m deeply proud of.</p>
